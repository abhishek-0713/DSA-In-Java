Introduction to Arrays

What is an Array?

An array is a collection of items of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. 

This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). The base value is index 0 and the difference between the two indexes is the offset.
